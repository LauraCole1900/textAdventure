## Description

This is a simple text adventure game using JavaScript alerts and prompts. Just enter your name and a cardinal direction (all lowercase, please!) and you're off on an adventure! A roll of the dice will determine the difference between life and death, between destitution and prosperity, between the life of a thief and that of a watchman. Come try your luck! And may the dice favor you....

NOTE: Currently, South is completely built out. East is nearing completion. North has been started. Please don't go West, you won't get anywhere.
